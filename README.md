Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. For users to be able to contact Mt. Pulag hikers, mobile phone numbers and email address are also shown alongside the social media icons. Icons are also animated on hover.

* Proper use of the flex box.


### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

1. Using semantic HTML.
2. Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
3. Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - e.g. social networks.
4. Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
5. Ensuring menus are accessible by fixing it on top of the screen.
