## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallete]()
The website uses the scheme to go with the colors of nature in the photography. Jocular green was used as a background color to stay true to the color of nature, and wizard blue as the clear skies as hover effect color on the input fields and submit button, and as response color on the buttons. The color palette was generated through the Coolors website.


### Typography

Fonts used for this site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Lato Google font was used as the primary font for the site for content readability.

  ![Main font]()

* Lobster Google font was used as the logo font for it to standout.
  
### Imagery

Photos of the trails, camp sites, and views from the trails and atop the summit were used in the website. Some of these photos are personal collections and some are taken from other hikers/photographers on the web, which I included in the [Credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are created for all the page sections using Balsamiq.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

1. Using semantic HTML.
2. Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
3. Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - e.g. social networks.
4. Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
5. Ensuring menus are accessible by fixing it on top of the screen.
